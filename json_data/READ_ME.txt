how to use this to send data to website:

assuming you are already running the website locally (if you are not, see the HOW_TO_USE.txt in the main folder)

in a seperate terminal(not the one currently running the website)

first, unzip the data.zip with(on linux): unzip data.zip
this will give you a ton of .json and some .xlsx files

second, to install requirements for python: pip install -r requirements.txt

third, run: python3 send_data.py
